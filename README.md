## Tranquility Home

### What is this?
This website for Tranquility Home represents the first webpage I've built, and my first time hosting a webpage (via HostGator).

### Background
While working as a waitress, I had a manager who was very passionate about setting up a sober living home for women in recovery.  

While she had already locked down a location, the house, furniture, and some informational brochures and photos, she still did not have a way to showcase this new home offering to those women who were still in recovery programs (and who would need to have a place to live arranged prior to graduation).  Alas, she did not yet have the budget to hire a fancy developer to build a website.

As such, I offered to create a website using the skills I was learning at the time, and created this website in exchange for a basket of tater tots. 

Since that time, the folks running Tranquility Home have updated the website and grown their operations.

It should be noted that all PDFs, application forms, brochures, and photos were provided to me by the program's organizers and are no longer current.
